# Kraky

**Kraky** is a DIY, open-hardware project inspired by the **Flipper Zero**, built using **cheap components** with a strong focus on **education, modularity, and repairability**.

Hi! I'm **Thesh**, a **17-year-old tinkerer** passionate about electronics, embedded systems, and learning by experiencing.  
I’ve always wanted a Flipper Zero, but its price was always out of my reach.  
Instead of giving up, I decided to design and build my own device from scratch — not as a replacement, but as a **learning experience**.

Kraky is not about shortcuts or hacking things blindly — it’s about **understanding how modern electronic tools are built**.
